I have been passionate about building things from a young age, especially systems that move, react, and solve practical problems. I started with Arduino-based projects, including an automatic kettle timer controlled by an RTC module and housed in a custom wooden enclosure. That project sparked my long-term interest in electronics design, troubleshooting, and repair.

As my skills developed, I began disassembling and repairing electronics at home to better understand how devices work internally. To improve my soldering and diagnostics, I started buying broken game consoles on eBay and restoring them. My repairs have included screen replacements, HDMI port replacements, jumper wire trace repairs for damaged pads, and fault diagnosis on a PlayStation Pro power supply that repeatedly blew fuses. I have also replaced ICs on Nintendo Switch boards and performed BGA reballing. Over the years, I built a complete repair setup, including a quality microscope, professional soldering equipment, and the tools required for precision board-level work.
