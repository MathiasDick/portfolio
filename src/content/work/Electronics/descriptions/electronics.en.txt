I’m most engaged when I can build systems that move, react, and solve practical problems. I started with Arduino projects, including an automatic kettle timer controlled by an RTC module in a custom wooden enclosure. That first build sparked my long-term interest in electronics design, troubleshooting, and repair.

As my skills developed, I began disassembling and repairing electronics at home to better understand internal failure modes. To improve soldering and diagnostics, I started buying broken game consoles on eBay and restoring them. My repairs include screen replacements, HDMI port replacements, jumper-wire trace repairs for damaged pads, and diagnosing a PlayStation Pro power supply that repeatedly blew fuses. I’ve also replaced ICs on Nintendo Switch boards and performed BGA reballing. Over time, I built a complete board-level repair setup with a microscope, professional soldering equipment, and precision diagnostic tools.
