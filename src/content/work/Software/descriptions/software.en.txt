I have been interested in computers from an early age. What started with gaming quickly turned into curiosity about how software works under the hood.

As my interest grew, I began building my own projects in Unity with C#. Through that process, I discovered how software can automate repetitive tasks, improve productivity, and turn ideas into practical tools. I also worked with Arduino programming to connect software with real-world hardware applications.

Over time, I gained experience across different systems and environments, including automation workflows, web scraping, and dashboard development. To continue improving my engineering skills and deliver practical value, I began offering freelance software development services.
