My interest in computers started with gaming and quickly shifted into curiosity about how software works behind the interface.

As that interest grew, I started building projects in Unity with C#. Through that process, I learned how software can automate repetitive tasks, improve productivity, and turn ideas into practical tools. I also worked with Arduino programming to connect software with real-world hardware use cases.

Over time, I gained experience across automation workflows, web scraping, and dashboard development. To keep improving my engineering skills while delivering measurable value, I began offering freelance software development services focused on reducing manual work and improving process reliability.
