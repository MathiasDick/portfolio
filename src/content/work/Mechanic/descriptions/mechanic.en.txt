My mechanical experience started early by helping my grandfather with Smart engines, then expanded through hands-on time in my uncle’s garage. That combination gave me a practical foundation in engine systems, diagnostics, and repair workflows.

Over time, I progressed from maintenance tasks to complete engine rebuilds. My first major project was a 1.4 TSI Polo with a burnt valve and no compression. After building my own home workshop and assembling the right tooling, I completed increasingly complex projects: a full Smart engine rebuild with new pistons, a full Seat Leon 2.0 TFSI EA113 rebuild with stuck valves, and a Golf VI GTI cylinder head rebuild.

In a recent Audi rebuild, I focused on precision by inspecting every surface, measuring critical tolerances, and confirming components were within specification, resulting in a stable and reliable engine after reassembly.

This systematic approach to diagnostics—isolating variables and verifying against specifications—is the same methodology I apply to debugging complex software systems.
