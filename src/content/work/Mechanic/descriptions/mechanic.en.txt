I have been passionate about working on cars from an early age. I started by helping my grandfather on Smart engines and later gained hands-on workshop experience at my uncle’s garage, where I spent my free time learning engine systems, diagnostics, and repair methods.

Over the years, I progressed from maintenance work to complete engine rebuilds. My first major project was a 1.4 TSI Polo with a burnt valve and no compression. After building my own home workshop and collecting the right tools, I completed increasingly complex rebuilds, including a full Smart engine rebuild with new pistons, a full rebuild on a Seat Leon 2.0 TFSI EA113 with stuck valves, and a cylinder head rebuild on a Golf VI GTI.

In 2025, I rebuilt the engine in my Audi with a strict focus on precision: inspecting every surface, measuring all critical tolerances, and confirming all components were within specification.
